* Find way to automate npm audit
  - currently have unfixed errors in dependencies of latest react-scripts
  - only fail if errors are above low priority?
    - there's no option for that
  - there are wrapper projects for npm audit.
  - can travis CI do warnings?

* Publish.
  - can only host via http since app connects to http-only FSA API.
  => can't use github pages.
  - https certificate
  - create proxy for S3 buckets and FHS
    - rate limiting?
  - config travis to publish to S3
    - publish files in dependency order
  - add link to README.md
  
* Use https://fb.me/react-error-boundaries to mask back traces.

* Failed-connection handling.

* Verify json metadata in case get paged data.
  - check meta.totalPages is 1.
  - check meta.returncode is OK.

* Download data using paged APIs, to prevent truncation.

* Local Authority could be removed while app running.

* Improve visual design.

* Localization.

* TypeScript/flow/PropTypes.

* jest snapshot tests?

* Automated browser tests.

* Test for too many local authorities.

* A way to refresh list of local authorities without refreshing whole page?
